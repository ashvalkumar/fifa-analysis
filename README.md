FIFA Player Data Analysis Project.
Project Overview:
This project involves a detailed analysis of FIFA video game data to explore player attributes, predict their potential, and identify distinct player types through clustering. It aims to provide insights that can assist football clubs, gaming companies, and sports analysts.

Dataset:
The dataset includes attributes for 17,918 professional players from the FIFA video game. It covers a wide range of information from basic data like age and nationality to in-depth gameplay stats such as dribbling, sprint speed, and much more.

Objectives:
Data Cleaning: Normalize data formats and handle missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand the distribution and relationships of player attributes.
Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning to predict player potential.
Clustering: Identify distinct player types based on their attributes.

Technologies Used:
Python 3
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning and clustering
Plotly for interactive visualizations
